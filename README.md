# Claim Generation for Zero-Shot Fact Verification (FEVER Dataset)

This repository contains the implementation of a pipeline for automatic **claim generation** using the FEVER dataset, developed as part of the **Information Retrieval** course at the University of Antwerp. The goal is to generate verifiable claims from source documents to support **zero-shot fact verification** systems.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* **00 - Documentation** : Containing all documentation written for the project
* **01 - Zero-Shot** : Contains the code, modules and data. It follows the same structure as the one generated by the notebook on google colab
* **02 - Data** : Sample data generated for the project
* **03 - Results** : Directory for the output files 
* **Claim_Generation.ipynb** : Notebook provided to run the project. It is prepared to run on google colab but with minor tweaks it will work locally.

This project demonstrated the integration of natural language generation, zero-shot inference, and information retrieval principles in a practical, end-to-end system.

> 🔗 Note: Large files are **linked externally** and are not uploaded to the repository.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
* Zero-shot claim generation pipeline using pretrained models (no task-specific training required).
* Integrated data preprocessing, claim extraction, and output formatting in a modular structure.
* Organized results for reproducibility and downstream evaluation.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
0. Copy the github repo to your local machine
1. Upload the notebook provided and follow the preparation instructions
