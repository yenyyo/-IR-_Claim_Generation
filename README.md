# Claim Generation for Zero-Shot Fact Verification (FEVER Dataset)
## Information Retrieval Course Project â€“ University of Antwerp

Designed and implemented a pipeline for automatic claim generation using the FEVER dataset, aiming to support zero-shot fact verification. The project focused on generating verifiable claims from documents and preparing them for downstream verification models.

#### This repository contains the following files and folders
* **00 - Documentation** : Containing all documentation written for the project
* **01 - Zero-Shot** : Contains the code, modules and data. It follows the same structure as the one generated by the notebook on google colab
* **02 - Data** : Sample data generated for the project
* **03 - Results** : Directory for the output files 
* **Claim_Generation.ipynb** : Notebook provided to run the project. It is prepared to run on google colab but with minor tweaks it will work locally.

This project demonstrated the integration of natural language generation, zero-shot inference, and information retrieval principles in a practical, end-to-end system.

Large files are linked and not uploaded to the repository

#### Installation
0. Copy the github repo to your local machine
